    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p><i>
        Pizza marinara is the simplest of classic Neapolitan pizza: that is, pizza in the style that originates from Naples, Italy. This pizza has simple toppings, a dough that’s thin in the middle and poofed on the outside, usually baked in a wood-fired oven at super high temperatures. Pizza marinara has no cheese: just tomato sauce, thinly sliced garlic, and oregano. It’s similar to pizza margherita, but without the cheese. Some sources state pizza marinara originated as early as the mid 1700’s in Naples.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <div class="list"><ul>
        <li>1 ball Best Pizza Dough (or Food Processor Dough or Thin Crust Dough)</li>
        <li>½ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 handful fresh oregano</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
    </ul></div>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <div class="list"><ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use).</li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings: Thinly slice the garlic clove. Chop the oregano leaves.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Top with thinly sliced garlic.</li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Garnish with a drizzle of olive oil, a few pinches of kosher salt, and the fresh oreagno. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
